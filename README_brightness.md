# Brightness Control Setup

## Current Status
âœ… Brightness controls are working with progress bars!

## What was done:
1. Added you to the `video` group to control brightness
2. Created a temporary wrapper script (`brightness_wrapper.sh`) to handle permissions
3. Updated i3 config to use the wrapper script

## After your next logout/login:
You can switch back to the direct script for better performance:

1. Edit `/home/kabin/.config/i3/config`
2. Change these lines:
   ```
   bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/brightness_wrapper.sh up
   bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/brightness_wrapper.sh down
   ```
   Back to:
   ```
   bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/brightness_control.sh up
   bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/brightness_control.sh down
   ```
3. Reload i3 config: `i3-msg reload`

## Files created:
- `brightness_control.sh` - Main brightness control script with progress bar
- `brightness_wrapper.sh` - Temporary wrapper (can be deleted after logout/login)
- `volume_control.sh` - Updated volume control script with progress bar
